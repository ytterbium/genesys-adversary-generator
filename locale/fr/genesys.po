"Passive; Your character creates a bond with a single animal approved by your "

"discretion, the bond may also be broken due to abusive treatment or other "
"extenuating circumstances.  As long as the bond persists, the animal follows "
"your character, and you dictate the animal’s overall behavior (although, "
"since the animal is only bonded with the character, not dominated, it may "
"still perform inconvenient actions such as scratching furniture, consuming "
"rations, and marking territory). Once per round in structured encounters, "
"your character may spend one maneuver to direct their animal in performing "
"one action and one maneuver during your character’s turn. The animal must be "
"within hearing and visual range of your character (generally medium range) "
"to do this. Otherwise, the animal does not contribute to the encounter. The "
"specifics of its behavior are up to you and your GM.  For every additional "
"rank of Animal Companion your character has, increase the allowed silhouette "
"of the companion by one (this may mean your character gets a new companion, "
"or their companion grows in size).  This talent can also change in flavor "
"depending on the nature of your game setting. While an animal companion may "
"make sense in many settings, in a futuristic setting it may make more sense "
"for the “animal” to be a robot or drone, for example."
